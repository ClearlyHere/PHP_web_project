# PHP_web_project
Learning to use PHP for web applications and learning to link data from a database to an interface.
Trying to adopt an MVC approach into this project for the first time and learning for future projects.

# Features :
- Login system with encrypdated passwords in the database
- Different user permissions, an admin can change certain user's information while a simple user can't
- See and manage data with essential SUID SQL commands 
- OOP and MVC structure for a more flexible codebase, class abstractions
- Customized error messages
- Implement cookies and sessions

Here are a few examples.
